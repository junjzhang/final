            <p>I first watched EVA when I was a middle school student. At that time adolescence I saw the same teenage
                protagonists confusion and growth is very much the same feeling.</p>
            <p>I grew up, but eva's new work was difficult to produce for various reasons. Last year, the last one was
                finally released, and I couldn't help but cry when I saw the people in the show reconciled with
                themselves
                and returned to real life.</p>
