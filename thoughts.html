            <p>I first watched EVA when I was a middle school student. I was shocked since I never wathched any work
                that is so dark but touch the bottle of my heart. I saw the young love, the first taste of failure, the
                confusion of young people about the future, and the confrontation between childish self-awareness and
                the real world. That's what I'm experiencing at that time. This niche and unique work satisfied my need
                to be different. Going into the obscure settings and deep, dark emotions made me feel like I was
                spiritually above my peers. Maybe that's how I fell in love with this work while being pretentious and
                empathetic. </p>
            <p>I grew up and more people around me came to see this work. I stopped using it as a capital to show off
                and started to understand this work from other perspectives. I learned about its influence on the
                Japanese animation industry, its artwork, its soundtrack, and its behind-the-scenes anecdotes. A new
                series was launched, and it seemed much more positive. Last year, the last one was
                finally released, and I couldn't help but cry when I saw the people in the show reconciled with
                themselves
                and returned to real life.</p>

            <p>This is my favorite scene from the Final. After all the treacherous battles and inner torment, shinji is
                back to real life with Mari.</p>

            <p>They are reconciled to themselves and are completed.</p>

            <p>Sure, the otaku has grown up, middle-aged boys have to enter society. Goodbye, my youth. Goodbye, all the
                Evangelions.</p>
