                <h2>Asuka Langley Soryu</h2>
                <img class="gallery-item" src="images/asuka-langley-soryu.jpg" alt="Asuka Langley
                        Soryu" />
                <p> My favorite character. The Second Child and Pilot of
                    Evangelion Unit-02. Nerv's highly trained pilot
                    ace, she is none too pleased at being upstaged by
                    Shinji, but is still drawn to him despite herself.
                    Her independent and
                    hot-tempered personality masks some old and painful
                    wounds. Her rebuild
                    counterpart Asuka Shikinami Langley is
                    treated as a separate character below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While adapted from Asuka Langley Soryu of the original
                    series, her
                    Japanese surname is different, and her characterization
                    diverges in highly significant ways over the
                    course of the New Theatrical Edition movies.

                <img class="gallery-item" src="images/shinji-ikari.jpg" alt="Shinji Ikari" />
                <p>The central protagonist of Evangelion, and the main pilot
                    of Evangelion Unit-01. Defeating the
                    Angel's and saving the world are the least of Shinji's
                    worries as he struggles to overcome his own
                    inner demons.

                <img class="gallery-item" src="images/kozo-fuyutsuki.jpg" alt="Kozo Fuyutsuki" />
                <p>Vice Commander of Nerv and Gendo's right hand. Fuyutsuki
                    was formerly a professor of metaphysical
                    biology, and was part of the UN investigation into
                    Second Impact. Though he once tried to reveal the
                    truth to
                    the world, he now works alongside Gendo as the two work
                    tow</p>

                <img class="gallery-item" src="images/gendo-ikari.jpg" alt="Gendo Ikari" />
                <p>Commander of Nerv and Shinji's estranged father. Gendo
                    Ikari has been given extra-legal authority by
                    the UN to defeat the Angels by any means neccessary; and
                    he has yet more powerful benefactors with
                    their own, darker goals in mind. But it is his own,
                    personal goal of reuniting with Yui which he
                    will stop at nothing to achieve.</p>

                <img class="gallery-item" src="images/kaworu-nagisa.jpg" alt="Kaworu Nagisa" />
                <p>The Fifth Child... and the Final Angel. Kaworu is sent to
                    Tokyo-3 by Seele to foil Commander Ikari's
                    plans, but along the way takes more than a passing interest in
                    Shinji. The Angel of Free Will, he chooses
                    to make the ultimate expression of his idiom.</p>

                <img class="gallery-item" src="images/kensuke-aida.jpg" alt="Kensuke Aida" />
                <p>Unrivaled Otaku of Class 2-A's and Shinji's friend.
                    Kensuke is Evangelion—mad, and always seems to
                    know more than he really should. He plays an important
                    role in the movie <em>Final</em>.</p>

                <h2>Mari Makinami Illustrious</h2>
                <p> A character from the Rebuild of Evangelion movie series. She is an Evangelion pilot and third party
                    operative introduced in Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance.</p>
                <img class="gallery-item" src="images/mari-makinami-illustrious.jpg" alt="Mari

                <img class="gallery-item" src="images/misato-katsuragi.jpg" alt="Misato Katsuragi" />
                <p>Nerv's Chief of Tactical Operations and Shinji's self
                    appointed guardian. Misato weighs her private
                    concerns against her professional duty as she works to defeat the
                    Angels and discover the secrets behind Second
                    Impact and Tokyo-3.</p>

                <img class="gallery-item" src="images/rei-ayanami.jpg" alt="Rei Ayanami" />
                <p>The First Child and Pilot of Evangelion Unit-00. Rei's quiet
                    speech and ethereal appearance belie her
                    greater nature, and purpose. Her connections to Shinji, Unit-01, and
                    Commander Ikari are deeper and darker than
                    they seem.</p>

                <h2>Ritsuko Akagi</h2>
                <img class="gallery-item" src="images/ritsuko-akagi.jpg" alt="Ritsuko Akagi" />
                <p>The Head of Project E and Nerv's chief scientist, Dr Akagi
                    employs the world's most advanced technology
                    to keep the Evangelions' enormous power restrained; barely.
                    Ritsuko is Misato's oldest and closest friend,
                    but she is deeper in the Commander's confidences—and more
                    besides.</p>

                <img class="gallery-item" src="images/ryoji-kaji.jpg" alt="Ryoji Kaji" />
                <p>Tokyo-3's most dashing triple agent, and an old flame of
                    Misato. Kaji runs a dangerous game of lies,
                    playing
                    Nerv, Seele and the Japanese Intelligence Ministry against
                    each other; and all while trying to discover
                    the
                    real truth for himself.</p>

                <img class="gallery-item" src="images/toji-suzuhara.jpg" alt="Toji Suzuhara" />
                <p>Class 2-A's resident jock and Shinji's close friend—after a
                    rocky start. But underneath Toji's tough
                    exterior lies a heart of gold.</p>

                <img class="gallery-item" src="images/yui-ikari.jpg" alt="Yui Ikari" />
                <p>Shinji's mother and Commander Ikari's lost wife. Yui's body
                    is lost to this world, but she lives on
                    inside the core of EVA-01.</p>
