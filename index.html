                What is Evangelion?

            <p>Neon Genesis Evangelion (EVA/NGE) is a Japanese mecha anime television series produced by Gainax and
                animatedby Tatsunoko, directed by Hideaki Anno and broadcast on TV Tokyo from October 1995 to March
                1996.
            </p>
            <p>Settings of this anime are mixed with a large number of religious elements, causing much Japanese anime
                imitation at the time. The setting of the episode itself is very obscure. But generally, the human here
                is the thirteenth apostle and will be attacked by other apostles. Thus, Seele, an organization thinks
                people should melt together and return to being Lilith. Then, Seele founds NERV and builds EVAs to fight
                against the other apostles while advancing the human replenishment program in the shadows.

                Director
            </h2>
            <img src="images/director.jpg" alt="Director Hideaki Anno" />
            <p>Hideaki Anno, the director, is the soul of the animation. The director incorporated many personal
                experiences into it, reflecting
                the confusion of young people in
                Japan at that time, which is actually a common phenomenon faced by young people all over the world.
                Interestingly, the creation of EVA seems to be a very painful thing for him. After finishing the old TV
                series, he tended to end EVA. But the expectations of his fans make it necessary for him to continue to
                write the story of this world. Under the inner torture, at the end of the old theatrical version, he
                inserted a short film to talk to the audience. He questioned whether the audience was satisfied and why
                they did not return to real life. But the good news is that he gradually reconciled with himself, and
                finally ended EVA with the last theatrical version last year, leaving a bright ending.</p>
