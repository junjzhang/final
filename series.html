            <p>After the "Second Impact", a catastrophe that struck the
                world, the world is rebuilt on top of the ruins.
                14-year-old Shinji is called by his father to the 3rd New Tokyo City. He was expecting
                to be
                greeted by his father, but instead, he sees a giant creature
                called "Apostle" fighting with the army. In
                a
                desperate situation, Misato Kasei of NERV, a secret service
                agency, rescues Shinji and takes him to the
                NERV
                headquarters under the command of Wataru. However, Shinji is
                greeted by his father's cold order to fight
                the
                Apostles in a giant humanoid robot called "EVA". Shinji, who
                had already refused, decided to obey his
                father's order after seeing his replacement pilot, Ayabari,
                who was seriously injured. In this way,
                Shinji,
                who has never been trained in combat, is ready to pilot the
                EVA's first machine to fight the apostles (angles).</p>
            <p>
                With the incoming Angles, the unidentified Ayapoli, and the
                pilot Sosuru Akane Langley from Germany, the
                14-year-old has to face challenges far beyond his abilities.
                While Anchorwatari is watching everything
                unobtrusively, a mysterious plan called the "Human
                Replenishment Project" is being realized according to
                his
                plan!</p>

            <p>The first part of the old movie version. It is divided into
                two parts: "DEATH" and "REBIRTH". "DEATH" is

                NERV to execute the "Human Replenishment
                Program." SEELE decided that this was an act
                of mutiny and decided to destroy NERV
                completely.</p>
            <p>At dawn, the NERV headquarters is suddenly attacked by the
                Strategic Self-Defense Force, who massacre

                Katsura ordered Asuka, who had a nervous
                breakdown, to be put on the second plane and placed in the
                depths of the lake, while she went to rescue
                Shinji herself. But at this time, Shinji was already on the
                verge of a nervous breakdown.</p>

                unit is able to defeat the opponent. Unlike the quiet Ayabari , Asuka is confident and even a bit
                arrogant, and in the days they spend with Shinji, they make a lot of jokes with each other. The three of
                them piloted the Zero, the First and the Second, respectively, to resist the fierce attack of the Eighth
                Apostle, and in the process, a faint love affair quietly sprouted in the hearts of these four young men
                and women. Soon after, the ninth and tenth apostles descended one after another, Shinji and they faced
                the cruel test of life and death.

                The third movie of new theatrical version Evangelion. Fourteen years ago, the awakening of the first
                unit of the suspected deification brought about the
                nearly third shocks, causing the world to undergo unprecedented changes. After that, Misato Katsuragi
                and other former NERV members left and formed the Wille to fight against Seele and NERV, and Wille
                ordered Asuka and Shinri to retrieve the Hatsune Mikoto and Shinji, who was sealed in satellite orbit,
                but forbade Shinji from boarding the first unit. Sensing the hostility around him, a dumbfounded Shinji
                follows Rei on board the suddenly invading Flight 9, and returns to the battered NERV headquarters.
                Here, he unexpectedly meets Ayami, whom he has longed for, and learns from his father that he will be
                piloting the 13th plane together with the beautiful boy Kaworu. The 14-year gap, the vicissitudes of
                change, and emotional entanglements overwhelm Shinji. But the seemingly gentle Kaoru reveals the
                unbelievable truth for him!

                My favorite one. The fourth movie of new theatrical version
                Evangelion. Shinji, who became the culprit of the "Third Impact", is depressed all day long. How can
                he
                recover from the sadness and save the world.
